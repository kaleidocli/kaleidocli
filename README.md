### **Hi there👋**

I'm a Computer Science graduate from **UC Irvine**. 

I always welcome new challenges and have practical experience leading projects and contributing to open-source work, and committed to delivering excellent results.

To me, challenges are not something to avoid. They are learning opportunities, regardless of the result.
