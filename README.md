Hi, I'm a Computer Science graduate from **UC Irvine**. 

I love finding challenges and providing solutions for them, because to me, they are great learning opportunities. Usually I would find things I want to improve, and write solutions to do so - which is basically how most of my open-source projects came to life.

Not only that, I'm the type that thrives in collaboration, because to me, the hardest part is figuring out what a piece of code should do, not just finding the best way to write it. This demands a great deal of communication between parties, and I'm very good at it.

On a sidenote, I've travelled through 15 states of America, as well as many places in the world. I love watching animes, reading light novels, and I have a whole set of different anime/gacha figurines, varying from 1:7 to 1:5 scales.
